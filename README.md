# Ameer's humble little Github Page

## A homepage for my github projects

I worked on various project's during my study and I found it rather interesting (at least for me). So I was thinking, "Man, everyone should know this!" like it's some kind of conspiracy theory or something. I mostly use this to backup my project file and I'm so glad I back it up on Github. At the end of the day, we're just humans and we get careless sometimes. So making a backup online makes much sense since we can access it any time we want on multiple devices. Make sure save it elsewhere for extra precaution.


## Projects I'm working on

I knew a bit of Kotlin. Really enjoyed the journey in making this app.
