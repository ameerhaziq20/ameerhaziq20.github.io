# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
A Computer Engineering Student from Universiti Malaysia Perlis located way up north of Malaysia (Like seriously, going further then we're in Thailand). During my time studying, I think the coolest part is making electronic systems and software projects which really mean taking pieces of knowledge from different subjects to develop something.

 The other cool thing that I learned which is way cooler than the aforementioned is Data Analytics. Hear me out, you can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data. The proess of Data Cleaning and Visualization really opens up to new field of knowledge and really shows the interesting stuff you can do with it through programming.
