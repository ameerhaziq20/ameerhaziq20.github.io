# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
A Computer Engineering Student from Universiti Malaysia Perlis located way up north of Malaysia (Like seriously, going further then we're in Thailand). During my time studying, I think the coolest part is making electronic systems and software projects which requires us to take pieces of knowledge from different subjects to develop something.

The other cool thing that I learned is Data Analytics. Hear me out, you can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data. Data analytics and data science really open up my field of knowledge and really shows the interesting stuff you can do with it through programming (especially Python).
